    "Part 1 of this introductory lab is used to install and import some packages that we will use throughout PHYS 231.  The installation will be done by calling a function called 'Check()' which is contained within the file 'installer.py'.  In order to use 'installer.py', the file must be located in the same directory as the active Jupyter notebook (i.e. the .ipynb file) and then it must be imported into the notebook.  The 'installer.py' file should already be among the files listed in the frame along the left-hand side of the screen.  The file can be imported using the following syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import installer\n",
    "```\n",

    "```python\n",
    "installer.Check()\n",
    "```\n",
    "These two line of code have already been entered into the cell below.  AS you can see, it is possible to have multiple lines of code in each cell.  To start a new line, simply hit the 'Enter' key when your cursor is at the end of the current line.  When you are ready for all of the lines of code in the cell to be executed, place your cursor anywhere within the cell, then hold down the 'Shift' key and hit 'Enter'.\n",
    "\n",
    "'installer.Check()' checks to see if some required Python packages/modules are already installed.  If they are, then the function outputs a message that its okay to proceed.  If one or more of the packages are missing, the function attempts to install them and then outputs a message that the user should completely log out of JupyterLab and then relaunch the notebook.  The next time 'installer.Check()' is run, it should simply confirm that the required packages are already installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should only be necessary to install the required packages once.  I recommend calling 'installer.Check()' at the start of all your PHYS 231 Jupyter notebooks as an simple way of confirming that the packages that we will rely on are properly installed."
